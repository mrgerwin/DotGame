# DotGame

In class you will:
1. Write a function that will add dots to the screen
2. Write a function that will destroy dots
3. Write a line that will add a dot every second

Then as a group will be determine how you will make the game better.

Use the graph paper to make a storyboard of how the app will change as you play the game.  There should be several scenes.  Determine which widgets will appear on the screen for each scene.

Work together in the same git repository or branch to code your game.

Test your game.  Record your tests and the results of those tests.

Redefine what your group wants to add or remove from the game.  Reiterate through the creation cycle.

When you are done, you will turn in your journal as evidence that your group was successful in making atleast 5 enhancements.
